# SafetyHelmetDetect

This project is used to detect people who is wearing or not wearing a Safety Helmet. To run this Project you need to make sure that you have Opencv, Mxnet, Gluoncv successfully installed. By the way, I use Python 3.5 in this project.

References for implementation:
[1] You can use Pip to install Opencv, Mxnet and Gluoncv.

[2] The pretrained model I use in this project is YOLO v3, the backbone is Darknet-53. The model is finetuned on a special dataset, here is the reference:https://www.cnblogs.com/supersayajin/p/11445401.html.

[3] Models is too large to commit, you can download here: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iYCJ_9CqZ55DdkwFiaKGrQ and the code is psog, and set up a new file folder named "model" and put them in it.

[4] You can just run the project in a default mode without any parameters. You can also use your own photos to run the project.
